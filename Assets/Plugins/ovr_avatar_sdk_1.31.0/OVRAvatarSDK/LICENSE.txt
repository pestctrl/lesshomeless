The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator who is an attorney-at-law with at least fifteen (15) years’ experience in consumer and technology transactions and who is also a member of the JAMS roster of arbitrators.

The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority.  You and Oculus agree the following may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction located within San Mateo, California and further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Mateo, California in connection with (a) any entrance of an arbitrator's judgment or decision, (b) any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure, (c) Oculus’ exercise of any of its equitable rights or remedies or (d) any claims regarding the ownership, validity, enforceability and/or infringement of any intellectual property rights.
